Through the terminal, go to the server folder and download the necessary dependencies. Then go to the client folder and download the corresponding dependencies. To do this, just run the following command in the terminal in each folder:
```
npm install
```
This command will download all the dependencies necessary for the application to start.

After downloading the dependencies, it is necessary to implement the .env file in both folders. Where you will have to include the following, 

On server:

```
PORT = Here you will include the port you want your application to be on e.g. 5005.
ORIGIN = Include the URL of your localhost: http://localhost:3000
MONGODB_URI = The URL of your database, in our case we used mongoDB
SESS_SECRET = whatever
STRIPE_KEY= Key to your Stripe account
CLOUDINARY_NAME = Your Cloudinary user name
CLOUDINARY_KEY = Key to your Cloudinary account
CLOUDINARY_SECRET = Secret key of your Cloudinary account
```
On client:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = Api URL
REACT_APP_API_KEY_MAPS = Key to your google maps api
REACT_APP_API_KEY_STRIPE_PUBLIC = Key to your stripe api
```

In your terminal go to the client root and run following the command:

```
npm run start
```

In your terminal go to the server root and run following the command:

```
npm run dev
```

You are now ready to use the application!!
